Biocomplexity and Randomness Readings
-------------------------------------

The problem with defining complexity and randomness is that they both already have very precise technical definitions, relating them to algorithmic information theory and [Godel's Incompleteness Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) in surprising and insightful ways.

[Gregory Chaitin](http://ufrj.academia.edu/GregoryChaitin) defines the complexity of something as "the size of the smallest program which computes it or a complete description of it."

Crutchfield, J. P., and Young, K. "Inferring Statistical Complexity." _Physical Review Letters_ 63, no. 2 (1989): 105-108. \[In the complexity measure defined by Crutchfield and Young, they attempt to define a measure of the chaos in a system using statistical mechanics.\]

Kauffman, Stuart. "Investigations: The Nature of Autonomous Agents and the Worlds They Mutually Create." _Santa Fe Institute Preprint_, September 13, 1996. \[Kauffman defines an molecular autonomous agent as a self-reproducing system that is capable of producing at least one thermodynamic work cycle.\]
