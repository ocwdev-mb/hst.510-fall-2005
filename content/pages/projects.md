Students in the course contribute to a class-wide project documented on the [course wiki](http://archive.is/kCNnE) Web site that provides decision-making tools for global and local technology development and deployment in the categories of [Personalized Medicine](#personalized_med), [New Energy Sources](#energy_sources), and [Biocomplexity and Randomness](#bio_and_randomness). Student project topics are listed below.

{{< anchor "personalized_med" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Personalized Medicine
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*   What is Personalized Medicine?
*   A Putative Scale of Personalized Medicine
*   List of Treatments, from Least to Most Personal
*   Possible Ways of Quanitifying How Personal a Method Is
*   Personalizedness Quotient
*   Technology Development Present and Future
*   Genome sequencing and resequencing
*   Genome-based assessment: functional and comparative genomics
*   Diagnostic tools
*   Medical informatics
*   Drugs (Imatinib)
*   Implementation: past lessons, economic analysis, access to care, data collection, privacy concerns
*   Medical Misdiagnosis: types of misdiagnosis, number of patients affected, monetary costs

We want a metric that helps us measure complexity and randomness in a way that is congruent with our intuition of complex systems. Some examples of real-world test cases:

*   Autonomous agents (systems that act on their own behalf) should have a high measure
*   Stock markets should have a high measure.
*   Natural language should have a high measure
*   Single-celled organisms should have a high measure
*   Multicellular organisms should have a higher measure
*   Some large-scale software systems should have a high measure
*   Ecosystems should have a high measure
*   Internet traffic should have a high measure.
*   Ideal gases should have a low measure
*   Perfect crystals should have a low measure.
*   White noise should have a low measure
*   A constant pitch tone should have a low measure
*   Stephen Wolfram's Rule 110 should have a low measure
*   Stephen Wolfram's Rule 30 should have a lower measure.
*   irreducible, structureless, incompressible strings should have a low measure
*   repeated patterns of irreducible, structureless, incompressible strings should have a higher measure.
*   Cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators should have a low measure
*   The digits of pi should have a low measure
*   Quantum randomness should have a low measure
*   Output produced from the logistic equation should have a low measure.
